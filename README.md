# BlueRoll

BlueRoll is a system using Bluetooth to monitor attendance. The system has the ability to register bluetooth devices as students, allows an instructor to locate nearby (within 10 meters) students and mark them as present, allows an instructor to manually enter attendance for students, and give a simple summary report to the instructor. Simply, it should allow an instructor to quickly take attendance in a class setting.
